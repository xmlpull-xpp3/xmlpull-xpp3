--- GENERAL

// ISSUE: specify exactly when XmlSerializer must be supported
    PROPOSAL: in J2ME both XmlSerializer and factory is option, on J2SE both are required

// ISSUE: in XmlPullParserFactory get/setFeature should it be used for XmlSerializer as well?
 PROPOSAL: get/setFeature in factory is only applied to newPullParser()


//ISSUE: how to write epilog?
	RESOLVED: write comment, pi or white spaces before calling endDocument()

//ISSUE: how to avoid possibility that user will call setPrefx and may override automatic prefix ...
	RESOLVED: all calls must be before startTag()

//ISSUE: if namespace set in setPrefix was not used shoul dit still result in xmlns:ns='' declaration?
	RESOLVED: YES -the prefix MUST be declared as may be used for attriburte values QNames etc.

//ISSUE: maybe replace flush() with closeStartTag() (if not used it is still called implicitly ...)
//      this will allow to write unesscaped strings safely (like for example BASE64 or hexbin)
	RESOLVED: left flush() with exact description what it does but also added text("") to close stag


//ISSUE: how to write efficiently unescaped XML
	RESOLVED: use flush() and write into stream ...


//ISSUE: where setPrefix() should (or not) be called (before first startTag(), between attribute() ...
	RESOLVED: setPrefix() MUST be called before startTag() is affecting only this startTag

//ISSUE: add close() that validates if XML document was writent correctly (finished depth == 0, etc.)
	RESOLVED: instead of close() use endDocument()

//ISSUE: additional properties to specify indent character, indent size, attrib quotation character
	RESOLVED: added get/setProperty to support it as options


--- DOCUMENTATION

//ISSUE: document that element and attribute names and namespaces are not escpaed!
//ISSUE: document that comment, CDSECT etc. are not escaped!!!
//ISSUE: docuemnt that duplicate attribute declarations are not detected !
//ISSUE: implicit closing of startTag() by text("") requires more description and exmaples!!!

---- FUTURE

// PROPOSAL: maybe have unesapced(String), unesapced(char[], off, len) methods?

//ISSUE: have one method tagWithContent() that combines startTag, text and endTag  ...
	RESOLVED: later ...

//ISSUE: should xml:space and xml:lang scope be maintained ?
	RESOLVED: not in this version
